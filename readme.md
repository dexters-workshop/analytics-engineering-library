## SQL

#### SQL | General

- [CTEs versus Subqueries](https://www.alisa-in.tech/post/2019-10-02-ctes/)
- [The most underutilized function in SQL](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/the-most-underutilized-function-in-sql/)
    > *In this post Iâ€™m going to show you two uses for md5() that make it one of the most powerful tools in my SQL kit.*
- [The Three-Valued Logic of SQL](https://modern-sql.com/concept/three-valued-logic)
    >*SQL uses a three-valued logic: besides true and false, the result of logical expressions can also be unknown. SQLâ€™s three valued logic is a consequence of supporting null to mark absent data. If a null value affects the result of a logical expression, the result is neither true nor false but unknown.*

- [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/about.html)
    >*A tool for easy online testing and sharing of database problems and their solutions.*


#### SQL | Filtering Data

- [HAVING vs. WHERE in SQL: What You Should Know](https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-having-vs-where/)
    >*"In simple words, the WHERE and HAVING clauses **act as filters;** they remove records or data that donâ€™t meet certain criteria from the final result of a query. However, they are **applied to different sets of data.** Thatâ€™s the important point to understand about WHERE vs. HAVING: **WHERE filters at the record level,** while **HAVING filters at the "group of records" level."*** ðŸ”¥

- [What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE clause?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-having-and-where-clause)
    >*Not the best article BUT I do like this clarifying statement: "If **GROUP BY** is used then it is **executed after the WHERE clause** is executed in the query. It means it selects the rows before grouping is done or aggregate calculations are performed. That's why, the WHERE clause is also called **Pre-filter.** But, **GROUP BY is executed before the execution of the HAVING clause.** It means it selects the rows after aggregate calculations are performed. That's why, the HAVING clause is also called as **Post-filter**."*


#### SQL | Assembling Data (Join/Union/Except/Etc.)

- [The problem of SQL fanouts](https://community.looker.com/technical-tips-tricks-1021/the-problem-of-sql-fanouts-30232)
    >*fanouts happen when joining tables having a one-to-many relationship; the primary table (left) is joined to the secondary table (right) and the result ends up having more rows than the left table began with.* this situation can cause errors when applying aggregate functions afterwards.  **three things to note:**
    > - **"no-fanout (one-to-one OR many-to-one):** you can trust aggregate functions on your primary table but not necessarily on your joined tables"
    > - **"fanout (one-to-many):** you cannot necessarily trust aggregate functions on either your primary table or your joined tables"
    > - **"help avoid fanouts (protip):** begin your joins with the most granular table (many-to-one)"

- [SQL Joins Using WHERE or ON](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-joins-where-vs-on/)
    >*Has a good illustration of filtering data prior to joining tables.*

- [Difference between WHERE and ON in SQL](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/difference-between-where-and-on-in-sql/)
    >*Makes the case that the WHERE clause and the ON clause should ONLY be used for there intended purposes, to filter and to join data, respectively. The author says this in the intro: "ON should be used to define the join condition and WHERE should be used to filter the data. I used the word should because this is not a hard rule. The splitting of these purposes with their respective clauses makes the query the most readable". **100% Agree!!! Prioritizing readability is key ðŸ”‘***

- [An Introduction to Using SQL Aggregate Functions with JOINs](https://learnsql.com/blog/introduction-using-aggregate-functions-joins/)
    >*Key Insight(s): using conditions in the JOIN predicate (after the ON) is not the same as filtering in the WHERE (or using HAVING). These can create subtle (or not so subtle) differences in your summarized data, which could result in hard-to-spot errors.*
        - *WHERE conditions are applied **after** the JOIN*
        - *conditions (for filtering) applied in the JOIN predicate are 
        applied **before** the join*




#### SQL | Grouping Data

- [Write better SQL: In defense of group by 1](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1/)


#### SQL | General Functions

- [SQL COUNT Function Explained with Examples](https://www.databasestar.com/sql-count/)
    >*Really nice article that goes over the syntax of count() and ALL of the nuances that matter when using it*

    ```sql
    -- what does count() do?
    COUNT(*)                   -- counts ALL rows, including duplicates and nulls
    COUNT(expression)          -- counts ALL rows excluding nulls
    COUNT(DISTINCT expression) -- counts ALL rows excluding duplicates and nulls
    
    -- basic syntax
    COUNT ( [ * | [ DISTINCT | ALL ] expression) [ over (analytic_clause) ]

    -- variations for how to call count()
    COUNT(*)
    COUNT(DISTINCT expression)
    COUNT(ALL expression)
    COUNT(*) OVER (analytic_clause)
    COUNT(DISTINCT expression) OVER (analytic_clause)
    COUNT(ALL expression) OVER (analytic_clause)
    ```

#### SQL | Window Functions

- [Let's Learn SQL Window Functions](https://madisonmae.substack.com/p/lets-learn-sql-window-functions)
    >*nice summary of window function's by Madison Mae (+with examples)*


- [[Video] Lead and Lag functions in SQL Server 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Zn5sdkamM&ab_channel=kudvenkat)
    >*excellent overview of these two functions (should generalize to other SQL dialects)*
    > - **lead** function used to access subsequent row of data along w/current row of data.
    > - **lag** function used to access previous row of data along w/current row of data.
    > - **order by** clase is required.
    > - **partition by** clause is optional
    > - **syntax:** LEAD/LAG(col-name, offset, default-value) OVER(ORDER BY col1, col2, ...)
